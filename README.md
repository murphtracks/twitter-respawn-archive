# Twitter Respawn Archive
### Over 9000 abusive ban evasion accounts suspended by Twitter

This repository holds a collection of Twitter accounts that were tracked by numerous anonymous volunteers primarily focusing on racist, antisemitic, and abusive Twitter users from 2018-2022. These accounts were tracked for the purpose of reporting ban evaders who have returned to the platform.

Due to frequent name changes by evaders and potential tracking errors this data should be independently verified for accuracy.

## About  
This repository serves as an archive of accounts associated with racist and antisemitic trolls who would "respawn" or create new Twitter accounts repeatedly after getting suspended. This list has been limited to users who have held 5 or more accounts, with information gathered over several years by anonymous volunteers.   

Most of these trolls hide behind created character personas and work together in coordinated harassment campaigns when targeting victims online. To gain a better understanding of what these troll swarms can look like we highly recommend reading this blog post on [Visualizing Cyber Harassment](https://medium.com/swlh/visualizing-cyber-harassment-7c4cad50bc8c), or [any](https://twitter.com/sundersays/status/1374983785624825856) of the [numerous](https://twitter.com/sundersays/status/1457683861689835525) Twitter [threads](https://twitter.com/gwensnyderPHL/status/1218978564122533890) written on the [subject](https://twitter.com/AnonCommieStan/status/1514310070049382406) over the years.

The racist respawner problem isn't over, but the progress made this year against racist abuse from these networks is significant. There are steps that can be taken by social media platforms to reduce this kind of abuse, one of which has been fairly successful is to identify the worst of these troll swarms and [implement an effort to suspend on sight](https://twitter.com/sundersays/status/1494316292840439809).

Currently, this abuse does still need to be [reported](https://twitter.com/nickmartin/status/1498080493736054784) when seen. You can help us track some of these abusers by submitting respawn information to our form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ecCGLAuslCIxEGaEMqGXJf1xFHInfDDpUh8JyFWZVN0/). 

## Collection Guide
| Category                    | About                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Persona** | "Persona" is used in lieu of "person" because most respawners do not operate under their own identity. However, they are consistent with character building and branding and would repeatedly return under the same persona after suspension. Some people operate multiple personas, and some personas are operated by multiple people. |
| **Approx Group** | Approximate group or friend network associated with the account. This is determined through interactions, friend lists, and follower lists. |
| **Date Active** | Date last seen active online; typically the date of a recent tweet. |
| **Status** | Account status. In addition to suspensions, this list also contains some accounts that have been abandoned, deactivated, and deleted by users. |
| **Date Suspended** | Date suspended is logged as accounts are suspended. |

## Core Groups 
Most of the users in this collection come from groups that frequently overlap and follow each other due to mutual interest in racism, antisemitism, and abusing others online.

|Group                      |About                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|**The Shed** |Racist and anitisemitic trolling group networked with "Nazi Twitter"|
|**America First** |White supremacist / white nationalist followers of Nick Fuentes|
|**Groyper / Fren** |Frog Twitter, primarily white nationalist accounts with frog avatars and varying levels of outward racism; the fren accounts tend to be milder than groypers, and these groypers align closer to the "OG Groyper" variety than the America First type|
|**Nazi** |Antisemitic white supremacist accounts, many of which explicitly post Nazi symbolism and Holocaust denial. Dataset note: this label blankets many accounts and some individuals may need further categorization|
|**Nazi Lounge** |Self-identified racist and antisemitic group that often organized on Discord and targeted Jewish individuals|
|**AnitwtKKK** |Anime Twitter KKK consists of racist and antisemitic Anime accounts. Note: lots of lolicon mixed into the group|
|**RGC** |The "Rapist Group Chat" is a self-identified incel group that often organizes on Discord and targets trans and Jewish people with doxxing and harassment; they are also known for recruitment and harassment of minors|
|**Irony Bro** |Edgy "dark humor" content, often trying to to hide racism in layers of irony and playing it off as "just a joke"|
|**RW Gimmick** |Right wing gimmick accounts, typically run by one of the irony bros or someone competent enough to not get suspended as quickly. They acquire many followers quickly and still manage to get themselves suspended occasionally|
|**Wignat** |White nationalist accounts unconcerned with optics who outwardly post Nazi accelerationist content|
|**Nazi Prop** |Nazi propaganda account; users who edit videos to share with their audiences. Lots of 'spinny wheel' spinning black sun edits |
|**Adj** |Adjacent; an account that frequently followed and interacted with members of a group but aren't as outwardly associated |
